# Getting Started with the FiftyOne Zoo

## Who this is for

This experience is designed for data scientists, ML engineers, and computer vision practitioners looking to explore and extend the FiftyOne Zoo — a unified interface to datasets and models.

Whether you're experimenting with public data, applying pre-trained models, or sharing your own assets, the Zoo helps you accelerate visual AI workflows.

## Assumed Knowledge

- Python and Jupyter basics
- Familiarity with CV tasks (classification, detection, segmentation)
- Some FiftyOne experience is helpful but not required

## Time to complete

30–45 minutes for step1 and step2
60+ minutes for step3 and step4

## Required packages

```bash
pip install fiftyone torch torchvision
```

### [Step 1: Exploring the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo](./step1.ipynb)  
Learn how to browse, download, and load datasets directly from the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo.

### [Step 2: Using the FiftyOne Model Zoo](./step2.ipynb)  
Apply pre-trained models to your datasets in just a few lines of code using the Model Zoo.

### [Step 3: Creating a Remotely-Sourced Dataset for the Zoo](./step3.ipynb)  
Build and register your own downloadable dataset into the Zoo for collaboration and reuse.

### [Step 4: Creating a Remotely-Sourced Model for the Zoo](./step4.ipynb)  
Define, wrap, and prepare custom remote models to behave like native Zoo models.

### [Step 5: Working with Dataset and Model Zoo APIs](./step5.ipynb)  
Explore how to programmatically and via CLI interact with the FiftyOne Zoo. Learn to list, load, configure, and register custom datasets and models using the Zoo APIs.
