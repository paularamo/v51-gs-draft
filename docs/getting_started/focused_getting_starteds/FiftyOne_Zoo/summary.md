# FiftyOne Zoo Experience Summary

The FiftyOne Zoo provides a unified and flexible way to load datasets and apply pre-trained or custom models — all from a single interface. This experience guides you from exploring public Zoo resources to leveraging remote assets hosted on GitHub or other platforms.

## Summary of Notebooks

### Step 1: Exploring the Dataset Zoo
Discover how to access and visualize public datasets directly from the FiftyOne Dataset Zoo, including support for remotely-sourced datasets defined in GitHub repositories or cloud URLs.

### Step 2: Using the Model Zoo
Apply pre-trained models like classifiers and object detectors to your datasets. Learn to quickly generate predictions and inspect results within the FiftyOne App.

### Step 3: Using Remotely-Sourced Zoo Models
Load and use external models hosted in public repositories or shared via URL-based archives. Wrap and integrate them seamlessly into the FiftyOne Model Zoo interface.
