# FiftyOne Zoo Experience Summary

The FiftyOne Zoo provides a powerful way to load datasets and apply models from a unified interface. This experience walks through everything from using pre-built Zoo resources to registering your own.

## Summary of Notebooks

### Step 1: Exploring the Dataset Zoo
Understand how to access public datasets like COCO or Quickstart and visualize them directly in FiftyOne.

### Step 2: Using the Model Zoo
Apply classification, detection, and segmentation models to your datasets using Zoo integration.

### Step 3: Creating a Remotely-Sourced Dataset
Design and structure your own dataset with loaders, downloaders, and metadata for Zoo registration.

### Step 4: Creating a Remotely-Sourced Model
Build a wrapper to support external models (e.g., ONNX, REST APIs, custom checkpoints) and integrate them into your workflow.

### Step 5: Working with Dataset and Model Zoo APIs  
Master the Dataset Zoo and Model Zoo APIs in FiftyOne. Learn to list available resources, load datasets with special requirements, apply models, control storage paths, and register local Zoo assets.
