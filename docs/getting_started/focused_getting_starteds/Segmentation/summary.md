# Segmentation Getting Started Series Summary

This short series walks you through the core components of working with segmentation data in FiftyOne — from loading and visualizing, to predicting and tracking masks.

## Summary of Steps

### Step 1: Loading Segmentation Datasets

Explore how to load segmentation datasets into FiftyOne using both built-in datasets from the zoo and custom datasets in COCO or mask folder format.

### Step 2: Adding Instance Segmentations

Learn how to add instance segmentation predictions to your datasets using both pre-trained models like SAM2 and your own models, including how to convert polygons and bounding boxes into masks.

### Step 3: Segment Anything 2 (SAM2) in FiftyOne

Dive into the advanced image and video segmentation capabilities of SAM 2, including prompting via bounding boxes or keypoints, and automatic segmentation for visual AI workflows.
